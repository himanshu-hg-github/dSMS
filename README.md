# dSMS - Document Sharing Management System

A social space for sharing important documents securly to specified number of friends in touch.
It allows the user to save documents for themselves with private access only.
Publicly accessed files feature can also be enabled as per choice.

This was a part of my industrial training / internship at Care Health Insurance Limited.
